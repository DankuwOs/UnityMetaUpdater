# UnityMetaUpdater
Terrible creation, don't expect it to work. ALSO BACKUP YOUR PROJECTS PLEASE DEAR GOD

Usage: open command prompt, drag in UnityMetaUpdater.exe, then the project with stuff you want to move to a new version, and then the new project.
Ex. Project 1.4.8 contains prefabs that I want to move to 1.4.13, I would put in <path to UnityMetaUpdater.exe> <path to 1.4.8> <path to 1.4.13> and press enter. You can drag in the files / folders instead of copying the paths.
